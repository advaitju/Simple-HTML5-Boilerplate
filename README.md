# Simple HTML5 Boilerplate
A basic HTML5 boilerplate that is ideal for prototyping and hacking designs together

## About
This boilerplate is quite simple and unlike the more thorough and popular [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) it isn't as thorough or comprehensive. __However, it isn't as confusing to a beginner.__ That is my main aim here.

It should cover most of your needs if you often need to quickly hack together a design for prototyping or small projects.

## Dependencies / Tech
Most dependencies have been added via CDNs to keep things simple.
1. FontAwesome
2. Bootstrap 3
3. jQuery

## Contributions!
Feel free to send PRs, fixes or contact me about ideas. Just KISS (keep it simple stupid) :)
