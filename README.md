# Simple HTML5 Boilerplate
A basic HTML5 boilerplate that is ideal for prototyping and hacking designs together

## About
This boilerplate is quite simple and unlike the more thorough and popular [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) it isn't as thorough or comprehensive. *However, it isn't as confusing to a beginner.* That is my main aim here.

It should cover most of your needs if you often need to quickly hack together a design for prototyping or small projects.
